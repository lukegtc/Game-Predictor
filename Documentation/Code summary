This README file constitutes the code documentation for this Computer Science project.
Before discussing the layout of our code, it is first important to understand the
structure of the website from which we are pulling. The basketball-reference.com site
has statistics on every baskestball ball game that has occurred within this century.
This site is organized by season. Each season has its own webpage which has a list
of games that have occurred within that season. For each item in this list, there is a
link by the name of boxscore, which is where we scraped our data points for each game
from.
The code begins with the urlpuller.py file which is used to pull the box score link
for each game for each season from which we pulled our statistics from. From here,
we created a separate script by the name of stat_scraper.py that pulls the specified
statistics from a link provided. We then make use of both of these scripts within the
pulllers.py script, which is used to created our data set. From here, we experimented
with ways of interpreting the dataset and transforming it in such a way that would
make it easier for the neural network to interpret. In order to create a dataset
that would be more easily interpreted by the neural network. The scripts that
attempted to omptimize the dataset include statdiff.py, date_remover.py and convNN.py
(which was used to create the dataset ConvDataSet.py).
After the dataset is optimized, it is then used in the neural networks named
secondtensor.py and second_NN.py. These two codes make use of the Keras package within
TensorFlow in order to make a prediction based on whether or not the outcome of a
set game will be a win or a loss for the away team.
