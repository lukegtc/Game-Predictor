Testing and Validation
In order to test the web scraping portion of our code, we originally analyzed what was
scraped. Since each of the links from which we scraped from contained the information
in a relatively simple format, we decided to compare what was scraped to what was 
located within the link. After confirming that the data scraped was the same as what
was located within the link. After this, we went on to scrape the required data 
from each of the links that were originally scraped. Everything was scraped properly
as it was all processed by the neural network. However, one season was not being
scraped for reasons unknown to us at the time. We ultimately ended up not including
that season within the training data, as it was not important to include consectuive 
seasons within the training data, as we were not having the neural network learn and
build off of the individual seasons, but rather, we were using specific games to learn
the patterns within the specific seasons. At the end of this process, we used the
predictions that were created by our neural network to test and validate the
results. We did this by comparing the output of the neural network to the actual
outcomes of the games we were testing the data on. We were able to confirm that the
55% success ratio that was created by the neural network was correct, as it was the 
same success rate that the code had when predicting the outcome of the games.
